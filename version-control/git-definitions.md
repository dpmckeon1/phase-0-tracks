# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control describes a system where multiple versions of a repository are saved in order to ensure capability to return to the project at previous points in time and reduce conflicts in the case of group projects.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is essentially an alternate copy of a repository. It is useful because developers can alter solely this alternate copy without affecting the core code and then submit it for review before it is merged with the master branch.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is the process of moving code from a local non-version controlled system into the git version control system. A good commit message should be descriptive of changes that were made and to the point.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when multiple branches have been initiated from a master branch and then they are merged back into that master branch without having accounted for the changes that each of these branches made to the code.
