# jQuery Plan of Action
## Dan McKeon

1. Determine the capabilities of jQuery
2. Choose one specific capability to focus on
3. Find HTML/CSS file from past work that would be conducive to this functionality (or create a new one)
4. Research how to implement...

Resources:

1. Google "jQuery [intended use] Tutorial"
2. jQuery Documentation
3. Google specific questions that come up during the process

Testing:

* Frequent testing required
* Since this is a new technology for me, I should make sure very basic functionality is operational before trying to implement complex code


I think it is the best approach to focus on one specific function because I learn best by doing and that is the method to get me "doing" as quickly as possible. I also sometimes have trouble choosing between many different options, so this plan will force me to choose one specific thing.
