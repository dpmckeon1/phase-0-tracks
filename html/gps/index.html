What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?

Provide more accessibility rather than generic tags and make page more reaadable.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?

Reads from top to bottom and left to right.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?

Learned how to create/modify snippets. That will be very useful as it can save a lot of time. Also learned some keyboard shortcuts from my GPS Guide.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?

Didn't remember how to use all the HTML5 tags immediately. I think the key is just to use them more and it will become second nature.
