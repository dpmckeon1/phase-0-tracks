Algorithm for Using Elevator:

1. Upon entering building, check directory for number next to desired destination.

2. Remove 2 right-most digits from number in step 1 and store as "Desired Floor"

3. Walk to front of elevator entrance - indicated by large metal doors periodically sliding open and closed with circular buttons to right with triangle with point facing up and triangle with point facing down.

4. Find number/character immediately to right of sliding elevator doors. If character, store "Current Floor" equal to 1. Otherwise, store "Current Floor" equal to number found in this step.

5. If "Desired Floor" is greater than "Current Floor", press button to right with triangle with point facing up. Otherwise, press button with triangle with point facing down. 

6. Upon hearing bell sound, elevator doors will open. Then walk in to elevator 2 feet, turn 135 degrees to the right, and there will be an array of circular buttons with numbers on them. Press button that is equal to "Desired Floor". 

7. Move backwards 2 feet to empty space and turn to right 45 degrees.

8. Read display above array of buttons from step 6 - update "Current Floor" to this number whenever it remains constant for more than 2 seconds. 

9. When "Current Floor" is equal to "Desired Floor", elevator doors will open. Navigate through elevator doors. 

10. You have now reached "Desired Floor"
